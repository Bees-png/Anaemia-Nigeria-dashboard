# Anaemia in Nigerian Women (2000–2023) — Power BI Dashboard

This Power BI project analyzes the trend and burden of **anaemia in women aged 15–49** in **Nigeria**, with a focus on differences between **pregnant and non-pregnant women** over time. The data is sourced from WHO’s Global Health Observatory and visualized to provide actionable insights for public health stakeholders and policy makers.
